Reported Bugs from Mantis: http://www.anope.org/bug
===================================================

.- Strange Segfault on expiring nicknames. Almost arbitrary, very hard
   to reproduce.

.- Clone detection can give false warnings if a user connects and then 
   signs off several times in rapid succession. Clone detection also 
   goes off wrongly if a server links and has a number of clients from 
   the same hostname.

.- If there is absolutely no activity on your network, Services may delay
   timed events (nick kills, database saving, etc.) until the next message
   comes in from Services' uplink server.

.- Modules will not work on OpenBSD machines, due to limitations on libdl.
